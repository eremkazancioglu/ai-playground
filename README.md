# How to train and deploy a image classification model in Sagemaker

## Motivation

The goal of this project is to have an image classification model that we can use to determine which of the four target species, if any, an image belongs to. We plan on using this model in the context of an app where users are assigned a species to look around for, they submit a picture if they think they got it, and the classifier determines if they are correct.

## Methodology

I will organize and document the methodology that I employed for this project as follows:

1. [Training data collection](how-to-train-and-deploy-a-image-classification-model-in-sagemaker/training-data-collection.md)
2. [Model training and evaluation](how-to-train-and-deploy-a-image-classification-model-in-sagemaker/model-training-and-evaluation.md)
3. [Model endpoint deployment](how-to-train-and-deploy-a-image-classification-model-in-sagemaker/model-endpoint-deployment.md)
